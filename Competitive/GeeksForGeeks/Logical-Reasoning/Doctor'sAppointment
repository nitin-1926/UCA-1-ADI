/*
Given two positive integers N and X, where N is the number of total patients and X is the time duration(in minutes) after which a new patient arrives. Also, doctor will give only 10 minutes to each patient. The task is to calculate the time (in minutes) the last patient needs to wait.

Input:
The first line of input contains the number of test cases T. The next subsequent lines denote the total number of patients N and time interval X(in minutes) in which the next patients are visiting.

Output:
Output the waiting time of last patient.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 100
0 <= X <= 30

Example:
Input:
5
4 5
5 3
6 5
7 6
8 2

Output:
15
28
25
24
56
