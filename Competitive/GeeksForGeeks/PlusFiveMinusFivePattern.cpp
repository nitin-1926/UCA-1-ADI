/*
Print a sequence of numbers starting with N, without using loop, in which  A[i+1] = A[i] - 5,  if  A[i]>0, else A[i+1]=A[i] + 5  repeat it until A[i]=N.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, number of test cases. Then following T lines contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case, print the pattern in newline with space separated integers.

Constraints:
0< N < 10000

Example:
Input:
2
16
10
Output:
16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
10 5 0 5 10

Explanation:
We basically first reduce 5 one by one until we reach a negative or 0. After we reach 0 or negative, we one by one add 5 until we reach N.
